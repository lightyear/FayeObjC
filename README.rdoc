= FayeObjC

A simple Objective-C client library for the Faye publish-subscribe messaging server. FayeObjC was implemented on top of the zimt Objective-C web socket library and JSONKit. This fork replaces zimt with SocketRocket (https://github.com/square/SocketRocket) and NSJSONSerialization. Due to the latter, it will only work on iOS 5.0 and Mac OS X 10.7 or later. Additionally, this fork requires the use of ARC.

= Mac Test Client

Included in the repository is a zipped release build of the FayeObjC Mac client.  This client allows you to test your Faye server, it connects over a websocket connection to the server specified and subscribes to the channel specified and will send messages via the server/channel it is connected to.

The messages are of the form { message: "some text" }

If you want to use the mac client to connect and test your faye server just unzip and start it on any mac.

The Mac client is available in the Downloads section of the repo - click "Downloads" to access it.

= Building the library

Using FayeObjC is as simple as adding the FayeObjC source folder to your Xcode project directory and then adding it to the project.  FayeObjC itself has no external dependencies, but SocketRocket does: libicucore.dylib, CFNetwork.framework, Security.framework and Foundation.framework.

Add these to your project by right clicking on Linked Frameworks in the Project and selecting Add->Existing Frameworks...

== Working with the library

Initialize a Client:
  // import the client
  #import "FayeClient.h"

  // init the FayeClient with a server and channel to subscribe to
  FayeClient *faye = [[FayeClient alloc] initWithURLString:@"ws://localhost:8000/faye" channel:@"/chat"];
  faye.delegate = self; // ensure that you implement the FayeClientDelegate functions
  // connect to the server
  [faye connectToServer];

Implement the FayeClientDelegate:
  - (void) messageReceived:(NSDictionary *)messageDict {
    DLog(@"message received");
    // do something useful with the message dictionary
  }

  - (void)connectedToServer {
    // Faye connection established
  }

  - (void)disconnectedFromServer {
    // Faye disconnected
  }

Send a message to the Server:
  // The message dictionary can be any dictionary structure that you want to send via the connected channel
  NSDictionary *messageDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Some message text", @"message", @"some meta information", @"meta", nil];
  [faye sendMessage:messageDict];


Using Bayeux Extensions:
  // Faye supports extensions to accomplish things like authentication
  // import the client
  #import "FayeClient.h"

  // init the FayeClient with a server and channel to subscribe to
  FayeClient *faye = [[FayeClient alloc] initWithURLString:@"ws://localhost:8000/faye" channel:@"/chat"];
  faye.delegate = self; // ensure that you implement the FayeClientDelegate functions

  // setup the extension and connect to the server
  NSDictionary *ext = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"testing", @"authToken", nil];
  [faye connectToServerWithExt:ext];

  // sending an extension with a standard message
  NSDictionary *messageDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Some message text", @"message", @"some meta information", @"meta", nil];

  NSDictionary *ext = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"testing", @"authToken", nil];
  [faye sendMessage:messageDict withExt:ext];


Example Project:

Included in the repository is a sample XCode project for Mac that provides a simple client application for interacting with Faye servers.  Try it out and have a look at the code for an illustration on the usage of the library.

The fayeMac sample project allows you to test out any Faye server.
